Unveiling the neural mechanisms involved in stimuli adaptation during frequency modulation for intraneural sensory feedback

The continuous desensitization to a prolonged stimulus is a phenomenon observed in all five senses, and it is referred to as Sensory Adaptation. It's purpose is the natural regulation of the sensitivity of our senses. More important and unexpected changes in our environment are given higher contrast with respect to continuous background signals. It's in the interest of this proposed project to investigate the mechanisms behind this adaptation. Further, to overcome the unwanted dampening effect of continuous peripheral neural stimulation in neuro-prosthetic devices through the understanding of this system. 

Previous work has been done in the investigation of the network responsible for the electrical tactile adaptation. Additionally, the equations governing the Dynapse-SE, a chip designed to emulate the biophysical properties of neurons and synapses, have been recently used to model SFA, STD and SFA in Brian2. These models of Synaptic Plasticity have been proposed as three main sub-mechanicsms involved in tactile sensory adaptation. 

The first focus of this Thesis would be to finish the modelling of SFA. To bias the model in a manner where higher input frequencies adapt the nerve fibers faster. The three mechanisms will then be impemented in the network proposed by Hoffman in a previous thesis, and to compare these with experimental data. In case the nework does not comply with experimental data, it's complexity will be scaled up through increased populations and layers with further review of the architecture.
